And when you tie the context to a business transaction, change cancellation becomes really weird to do.

Simple Injector can&#39;t possibly know which of the registered implementations it should inject (since probably all validators could be injected). So what you need is to inject a mediator that can dispatch the validated instance to the real validator. This mediator must be registered exllicitly.

Steven,Stack Overflow,2014-12-24 20:24:17Z,comment,Better way to resolve the binding of multiple services when the context is the same in Ninject?,"Your <code>ClassToDeserialize</code> seems to be a DTO. DTOs, entities, messages, and other classes that hold data should not be registered in your container. Containers are for resolving components; classes that have behavior. Any time you try to mix data and behavior and register it in your container, things will go wrong. So data classes should not have dependencies. They should simply be &#39;pushed&#39; through the object graph that you resolved using your container. You should refactor your code accordingly and a lot of problems will disapear when doing that."

Since LINQ and collection enumeration in general causes allocation of heap objects, I prevent using LINQ. For everything outside of the happy path however (which is 95% of the code base), I make extensive use of LINQ because it makes programming easier, more maintainable, and more fun. But note that I <i>only</i> prevent LINQ in that 5% because I build a reusable framework where this kind of performance is critical."

Data structures (runtime values) are passed to methods (such as action methods and methods on services). These structures should contain no business logic and only simple logic and data.

If you are in a really constraint environment where memory is an issue, you can design your commands as value types (structs) and design your command handlers (and other services) as singletons. This means that you create all services once (probably during application start-up, with decorators and all) and you the rest of the application could free from doing heap allocations. Creating an application under these tight constraints is -without any doubt- hard, but DI doesn&#39;t make this any harder."

Another short come is that it will be unclear from looking at the constructor of classes in the system, that they actually make use of this factory. Code becomes harder to follow and it becomes easier to violate the Single Responsibility Principle. The solution to all of this, is to inject a factory into consumers, instead of letting consumers refer to <code>Factory.Instance.Create()</code>. By using an interface, you can define the implementation of this factory in the composition root, and you can inject the container into this implementation without using the Service Locator anti-pattern."

Unit tests should ensure that the configuration is correct (these tests are normally very straightforward). A miss-configured logging system is of course still possible, but this is not DI specific. Using DI is of course an extra layer of abstraction, but my experience is that it makes development much simpler. In fact, letting your application depend on an <code>ILogger</code> interface instead of a concrete logging subsystem, can hardly be considered over engineered and I would certainly consider this KISS."

If you look at the source code in .NET you see that some types behave the same when doing <code>Close</code> or <code>Dispose</code>, while others don&#39;t. I think it is safe to say that you shouldn&#39;t count on <code>Close</code> to properly free your resources. For instance, the <code>SqlConnection</code> does not call <code>GC.SuppressFinalize(this)</code> during a call to this, which force the object to live much longer than strictly needed. Therefore, you can conclude that your statement is true and the guideline holds: If an instance implements <code>IDisposable</code>: you should call dispose."

In Fowler’s pattern, the consumer specifies the query by creating a set of <code>Criteria</code> objects. This is, in fact, exactly what we do when using  <code>IQueryable</code>.

Steven,Stack Overflow,2010-08-31 08:07:45Z,comment,Validation Application Block Questions,"VAB does work fine when it comes to cross field or cross object validations. For cross field validations, you need to register the validator on the &#39;self&#39; right below the <code>&lt;ruleset&gt;</code> element in the configuration or use the <code>[HasSelfValidation]</code> and <code>[SelfValidation]</code> attributes when defining validation inside the object itself. When it comes to cross object validations, this will be a lot harder, but that has nothing to do with VAB itself. Cross-object validations is hard per definition.

When you&#39;re doing more than just disposing resources in a <code>Dispose</code> method, the changes of an exception being thrown from that <code>Dispose</code> method are higher. <code>Dispose</code> is also called in the context of an <code>Exception</code>, and in that case you would be replacing that exception with a new one, making debugging, and finding the cause of the exception, harder.

Integration tests should be a last resort and you should try to make the architecture unit test friendly. However, doing this takes a lot of effort (and experience). As a consultant I often advice less experienced teams to start doing integration tests, because I requires less changes to their architecture.

The reason is simple, because an invalid result is something that must get noticed. The last thing you would want is that a developer calls Save and forgets to check whether your data is actually saved. There is no rule that says that exception can only be used in unrecoverable situations. Besides, the exception would normally only get logged when they are unhandled. In the <code>Save</code> method example in my answer, you see the exception gets handled. Your log will only get cluttered if you use profiling to log every thrown exception."
